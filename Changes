Revision history for Tempest

2009.10.31
        Forgot to add the GraphicsMagick adapter to the manifest, so it was
        never included in the last two packaged releases.  Oops.

2009.10.07
        Made image comparisons (in unit tests) more stable and forgiving of
        version differences

2009.10.05
        Added full support for Graphics::Magick.  Some minor but important
        changes from the ImageMagick adapter (notably the lack of Fx or Clut
        operators, meaning a manual color lookup implementation)

2009.07.15
        Added has_image_lib method, as specified in API version 2009.07.15.
        Added tests for this and all other public static methods.

2009.07.03
        Fixed dubious dependancy tests (for GD and Image::Magick) bundled with
        the distribution.  *Now* this should fix the failures in the CPAN
        testers matrix.

2009.07.02
        In ImageMagick adapter, now checking if Clut method is supported and,
        if it's not, use the Fx operator instead.  This should fix the failures
        in the CPAN testers matrix.

2009.06.28
        Completely rewrote colorization to be simpler & produce more precise
        results. In the process, fixed opacity issues where the opacity was
        unintentionally inverted.
        
        Also expanded on lib-specific tests to include opacity comparisons.

2009.06.25
        First release packaged as a CPAN module.
