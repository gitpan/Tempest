Revision history for Tempest

2009.07.03
        Fixed dubious dependancy tests (for GD and Image::Magick) bundled with
        the distribution.  *Now* this should fix the failures in the CPAN
        testers matrix.

2009.07.02
        In ImageMagick adapter, now checking if Clut method is supported and,
        if it's not, use the Fx operator instead.  This should fix the failures
        in the CPAN testers matrix.

2009.06.28
        Completely rewrote colorization to be simpler & produce more precise
        results. In the process, fixed opacity issues where the opacity was
        unintentionally inverted.
        
        Also expanded on lib-specific tests to include opacity comparisons.

2009.06.25
        First release packaged as a CPAN module.
