Revision history for Tempest

2009.06.28
        Completely rewrote colorization to be simpler & produce more precise
        results. In the process, fixed opacity issues where the opacity was
        unintentionally inverted.
        
        Also expanded on lib-specific tests to include opacity comparisons.

2009.06.25
        First release packaged as a CPAN module.
